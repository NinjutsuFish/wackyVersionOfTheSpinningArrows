# What is this??
Was originally an attempt at writing a propgramme for the discrete fourier transform at the time but my lack of understanding meant it ultimately became a c++ programme to draw lines which rotated. For an actually implemented version see my other github repo called Discrete Fourier Transford


I am just keeping this here as a reference for using some libraries in c++.
