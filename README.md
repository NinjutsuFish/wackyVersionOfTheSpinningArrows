# What is this??
idk i saw some fourier thing and didnt get it. so i made a trash version. which was just the spinning arrows
made using sdl 2.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# using it
just run it and it asks for how many lines
slight issue is that i used floats instead of longs for the length of lines. or something so since the lines get shorter the more there are

oh and it crashes or something after a while....
welp

# this project is 

-buggy-ish
-also i m pretty sure certain combinations draw pictures just what they are is unknown


# how to add arrow but like however you want it
all you have to do is arrows.push_back(arrow([Turns per second goes here],[the length here]))

however they are all random atm sooooooooooooooo it draws t r a s h


actually programmed something tho so niceeeeeeeeeeeeee
